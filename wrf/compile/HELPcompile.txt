These are the steps to compile WRF. I will try to be as explicit as possible.
1. Copy the "beninstallfor*.sh" script to the "WRFV3" directory.
2. Copy the "configure_*.wrf" to a folder called "custom_configure" in the "WRFV3" directory.
3. Now that you have those two files in place, you can run the compilation script.
4. Choose the option that is most appropriate. The option for just the host (should be option 25) reads:
       "Linux x86_64 i486 i586 i686, Xeon (SNB with AVX mods) ifort compiler with icc  (dm+sm)"
   is the one that you should choose if trying to compile for the host (dm+sm means OpenMP + MPI).
   If you're compiling for the Xeon Phi, use this one, which should be option 21:
       "Linux x86_64 i486 i586 i686, Xeon Phi (MIC architecture) ifort compiler with icc  (dm+sm)"
5. Just choose the default option for nesting.  This is an extremely niche option that we will not use.
6. WRF will now start compiling.  If anything goes wrong, it's most likely the case that paths have changed,
   in which case you should change the paths in "beninstallfor*.sh".
7. Once that's done, move on to the "HELP.txt" for running WRF.
